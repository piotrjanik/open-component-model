This page is the technical reference for built-in resource repositories. For an introduction to what resource
repositories are and why they exist, see
[Concept: Resource Repositories]({{< relref "docs/concepts/resource-repositories.md" >}}).

## OCI Resource Repository

Handles OCI artifacts stored in OCI-compliant registries.

### Supported Access Types

| Access Type                                                            |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`OCIImage/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#ociimagev1) |

### Capabilities

| Operation         | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Download          | Yes       |
| Upload            | Yes       |
| Digest Processing | Yes       |

### Credential Resolution

The credential consumer identity is derived from the `imageReference` field in the access specification. The registry
hostname is extracted from the image reference to construct an identity of type `OCIRegistry`.

**Example:** For a resource with access `imageReference: ghcr.io/acme/myapp:1.0.0`, the resolved identity is:

| Attribute  | Value         |
|------------|---------------|
| `type`     | `OCIRegistry` |
| `hostname` | `ghcr.io`     |
| `scheme`   | `https`       |

This identity is then matched against configured consumers in the credential system.
See [Credential Consumer Identities: OCIRegistry]({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md" >}}#ociregistry) for
matching rules.

### Download Behavior

Downloads the complete OCI artifact (manifest and layers) from the registry. The returned blob represents the artifact
in its OCI format.

### Upload Behavior

Pushes an OCI artifact to the target registry. The resource descriptor is updated with the repository-specific access
information (e.g., the final image reference with digest) after upload.

### Digest Processing

The OCI resource repository also implements digest processing. When constructing a component version with a by-reference
resource, OCM queries the registry to resolve and verify the artifact's digest, ensuring the resource descriptor is
pinned to an immutable reference.

## Helm Resource Repository

Handles Helm charts stored in HTTP/HTTPS-based chart repositories.

### Supported Access Types

| Access Type                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`Helm/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#helmv1) |

### Capabilities

| Operation         | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Download          | Yes       |
| Upload            | No        |
| Digest Processing | Yes       |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Upload is not supported because traditional Helm chart repositories are read-only HTTP servers that serve a static
`index.yaml` and packaged chart archives. There is no standardized upload API.

For Helm charts stored in OCI registries, use the [OCI resource repository](#oci-resource-repository) with an [
`OCIImage/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#ociimagev1) access type instead.
{{< /callout >}}

### Credential Resolution

The credential consumer identity is derived from the `helmRepository` field in the access specification. The identity
type is `HelmChartRepository`.

**Example:** For a resource with `helmRepository: https://stefanprodan.github.io/podinfo`:

| Attribute  | Value                    |
|------------|--------------------------|
| `type`     | `HelmChartRepository`    |
| `hostname` | `stefanprodan.github.io` |
| `scheme`   | `https`                  |
| `path`     | `podinfo`                |

If the resource has no `helmRepository` (a local chart embedded via input), no credential identity is returned — local
charts do not require remote authentication.

See
[Credential Consumer Identities: HelmChartRepository]
({{< relref "credential-consumer-identities.md" >}}#helmchartrepository)
for matching rules.

### Download Behavior

Downloads the Helm chart (and optional `.prov` provenance file) from the remote repository. The chart is packaged into a
tar archive and returned as an in-memory blob.

The `helmChart` and `helmRepository` fields from the access specification are combined to construct the full chart
reference used for download.

### Digest Processing

The Helm digest processor resolves chart digests from the remote repository. For HTTP/HTTPS repositories it downloads
the `index.yaml` and extracts the digest for the specified chart and version. For OCI-based Helm repositories it
resolves the OCI manifest digest via the registry API.

## GitHub Resource Repository

Handles source archives of a pinned commit in a GitHub (or GitHub Enterprise) repository.

### Supported Access Types

| Access Type                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`GitHub/v1`]({{< relref "input-and-access-types.md" >}}#githubv1) |

### Capabilities

| Operation         | Supported |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Download          | Yes       |
| Upload            | No        |
| Digest Processing | Yes       |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
Upload is not supported: the `GitHub/v1` access type is a read-only source reference. Content is pushed to GitHub
through git, not through OCM.
{{< /callout >}}

### Credential Resolution

The credential consumer identity is derived from the `repoUrl` field in the access specification. The identity type is
`GitHubRepository`.

**Example:** For a resource with `repoUrl: https://github.com/open-component-model/ocm`:

| Attribute  | Value                       |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| `type`     | `GitHubRepository`          |
| `hostname` | `github.com`                |
| `scheme`   | `https`                     |
| `path`     | `open-component-model/ocm`  |

This identity works the same way for GitHub Enterprise hosts. The resolved credentials must supply a `token` property
(a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise access token) used to authenticate against the GitHub REST API.

### Download Behavior

Downloads the source archive of the commit pinned in the resource's access (`commit`, or the commit resolved from `ref`
by digest processing) via the GitHub REST API. The archive is returned as an in-memory gzipped tar blob.

On transfer to an OCI or CTF target, this downloaded archive is stored as a `localBlob` in the target repository.

### Digest Processing

The GitHub digest processor resolves a by-reference access (one carrying only a `ref`) to a concrete `commit`, pinning
it onto the resource — mirroring OCI tag-to-digest pinning. It then downloads the archive at that commit and computes a
generic blob digest over it, so a by-reference GitHub resource carries the same digest it would have as an embedded
local blob. If `commit` is already set, the resolved commit is verified against it instead.

## External Resource Repositories (Plugins)

External plugins declare supported access types in their capability specification and implement the same three
operations (resolve credential identity, download, upload) over the plugin protocol. Once installed, OCM routes requests
for matching access types to the plugin automatically.

See [Concept: Plugin System]({{< relref "docs/concepts/plugin-system.md" >}}) for details on building and installing
plugins.
